        <h1 id="Taxpayers-Foot-the-Bill-for-Millions-in-Gambling-Losses"><a href="#Taxpayers-Foot-the-Bill-for-Millions-in-Gambling-Losses" class="headerlink" title="Taxpayers Foot the Bill for Millions in Gambling Losses"></a>Taxpayers Foot the Bill for Millions in Gambling Losses</h1><p>Each year, state and federal governments spend millions of taxpayer dollars to reimburse casinos and lotteries for losses incurred by gamblers. In many cases, these reimbursements are made even though the casinos and lotteries are aware that the players are likely to incur losses.</p>
<p>Casinos enjoy a special status under the law, which allows them to recover losses from players even when those players have not broken any laws. This is known as the “right of repayment.” Casinos can pursue repayment from players even when those players have no assets to speak of and no ability to pay.</p>
<p>The right of repayment dates back to a time when gambling was seen as a vice that needed to be discouraged. Lawmakers felt that it was important to protect casinos from losing money due to player mistakes. Over time, this protection has morphed into a subsidy for the gambling industry.</p>
<p>In many cases, reimbursements are made for wagers that were placed on games that have almost no chance of winning. For example, the House of Representatives in Pennsylvania recently approved a measure that would allow casinos to seek reimbursement for losses incurred while playing games like keno and electronic blackjack. These games are essentially a form of slot machines, and they are notorious for being unfair to players.</p>
<p>The reimbursement process is also opaque and shrouded in secrecy. There is no public accounting of how much money is spent each year on reimbursements, nor is there any information about how the decisions are made about which casinos and lotteries receive money from taxpayers.</p>
<p>There is also little information about how much money casinos make from reimbursed losses. It is safe to assume that the amount of money involved is significant, especially when you consider that there are thousands of casinos across the United States.</p>
<p>It’s time for taxpayers to stop footing the bill for gambling losses. The right of repayment should be abolished so that casinos can no longer rely on subsidies from the public treasury.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Losses-Top-117-Billion-in-2017"><a href="#Gambling-Losses-Top-117-Billion-in-2017" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Losses Top $117 Billion in 2017"></a>Gambling Losses Top $117 Billion in 2017</h1><p>For the third consecutive year, gambling losses topped $100 billion in the United States. In 2017, Americans lost a total of $117.5 billion gambling, up from $110.8 billion in 2016 and $98.9 billion in 2015. Gambling is not just an individual problem; it also has significant societal costs.</p>
<p>Gambling can take many forms, including casino games, lotteries, sports betting, and pokies (slot machines). The largest portion of losses—$55.7 billion—came from casino games, while lotteries were responsible for $23.5 billion in losses. Sports betting accounted for $4.7 billion in losses, and pokies were responsible for $13.5 billion.</p>
<p>Gambling is not a victimless crime; it has serious consequences for individuals, families, and communities. Gambling addiction can destroy relationships and lead to financial ruin. Children of problem gamblers are more likely to experience poverty and abuse than children of non-gambling parents. Problem gambling also imposes significant costs on society as a whole.</p>
<p>In 2017, problem gambling cost the United States more than $6 billion in health care expenses, criminal justice system expenses, and lost productivity. This does not include the costs associated with gambling addiction treatment or prevention programs.</p>
<p>Clearly, gambling is a significant social problem that demands attention from lawmakers and policy makers at all levels of government. The best way to address this problem is to make sure that people have access to information about the risks associated with gambling and that those who develop problems have access to treatment services.</p>
<h1 id="Gamblers-Lose-Over-500-Per-Second"><a href="#Gamblers-Lose-Over-500-Per-Second" class="headerlink" title="Gamblers Lose Over $500 Per Second"></a>Gamblers Lose Over $500 Per Second</h1><p>There’s big money in gambling, and not just for the people who are winning. The industry as a whole generated nearly $650 billion in revenue in 2017, and it’s only growing. Casinos and other gambling venues make money by taking a cut of every wager placed.</p>
<p>While some people win big, the vast majority of gamblers lose. In fact, over the course of an hour, PokerAtlas reports that gamblers lose an average of $520 per second. That’s a lot of money down the drain.</p>
<p>So why do people keep gambling despite the overwhelming odds against them? Part of it has to do with the high potential rewards. Gambling can offer the chance to win big bucks quickly and easily. It can also be exciting and fun, something that many people find hard to resist.</p>
<p>Compulsive gambling can also be addictive, leading people to keep betting even when they know they’re going to lose money. This is a serious problem that can ruin lives. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek help.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that gambling is a risky proposition that often ends in disaster for most players. If you want to risk your money, that’s your decision, but don’t be surprised if you end up losing more than you bargained for.</p>
<h1 id="Americans-Lost-More-Than-40-Billion-on-Gambling-in-2016"><a href="#Americans-Lost-More-Than-40-Billion-on-Gambling-in-2016" class="headerlink" title="Americans Lost More Than $40 Billion on Gambling in 2016"></a>Americans Lost More Than $40 Billion on Gambling in 2016</h1><p>$40,600,000,000 is a lot of money. Especially when it’s the amount of money Americans lost gambling in 2016. This averages out to $1,270 per adult in the country.</p>
<p>The states with the most gambling losses were Nevada ($6.5 billion), New Jersey ($3.5 billion), and Pennsylvania ($2.9 billion). These states also have some of the most casinos and gambling options in the country.</p>
<p>While there are many who enjoy gambling and see it as a fun way to pass the time, there are also many who lose money on gambling every year. In fact, 15% of gamblers account for 85% of all gambling losses. This means that a small number of people are losing a lot of money on gambling each year.</p>
<p>Gambling can be addictive, which is one reason why so many people lose money on it. Gambling addiction can cause people to lose their jobs, their homes, and even their families.</p>
<p>There are some steps that can be taken to help prevent addiction and minimize losses from gambling. These steps include setting limits on how much money can be spent on gambling, not gambling when feeling stressed or anxious, and seeking counseling or treatment for addiction if needed.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Leads-Country-in-Gambling-Losses"><a href="#Nevada-Leads-Country-in-Gambling-Losses" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Leads Country in Gambling Losses"></a>Nevada Leads Country in Gambling Losses</h1><p>Nevada continues to lead the nation in gambling losses, according to the annual Nevada Gaming Commission report released last week.</p>
<p>For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016, gamblers lost $10.8 billion – a slight decrease from the previous year’s total of $11.1 billion. Slot machines accounted for the lion’s share of losses, accounting for $9.3 billion – or 87 percent – of the total.</p>
<p>The report also found that gaming revenue in Nevada declined 3.5 percent to $11.2 billion in 2016, marking the fourth consecutive year of declines. This was due largely to a continued slowdown in slot machine play and a drop in spending by out-of-state visitors.</p>
<p>In spite of this, Nevada remains far and away the country’s gambling capital, with gaming revenue comprising more than one-third of all legal gaming revenue nationwide. In fact, six of the 10 states with the highest gambling losses are in the West Coast region, with California ranking second behind Nevada.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this regional concentration of gambling losses. First, most states have either banned or severely restricted gambling activity within their borders, while Nevada has embraced it as a key part of its economy. Second, California and other states near Nevada have large populations and plenty of tourists who are eager to try their luck at casinos and other gaming venues. Finally, Las Vegas and other casino towns in Nevada offer an array of entertainment and dining options that rival those found in any other city in the country.</p>
<p>So even though gambling losses continue to decline nationally, don’t expect them to go away anytime soon – especially not in Nevada!</p>

#  Benicio Del Toro Shows Blackjack Strategy Cart on 'The Late Show With Stephen Colbert'

Benicio Del Toro stopped by "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" on Wednesday night, and he brought along a very special guest: his blackjack strategy cart.

Del Toro explained that the cart is a prop from his upcoming movie "Knives Out," and showed how it works by playing a game of blackjack against Colbert.

The actor started out strong, but Colbert eventually managed to win some money off of him. Check out the video below to see the full segment.

Blackjack is a popular casino game that can be played with one or more decks of cards. The goal is to draw cards that total 21, or as close to 21 as possible, without going over. If the player goes over 21, they lose automatically.

The game is usually played with one deck of 52 cards, but can be played with more decks if both players agree. Aces are worth 1 or 11 points, 2 through 10 are worth face value, and a Jack, Queen or King (J,Q,K) are each worth 10 points.

In most casinos, the dealer must hit on 16 and stand on 17. However, some casinos require the dealer to hit on soft 17 (an Ace plus any other number). players have the option to double down (double their bet and receive just one more card), split (split their hand into two separate hands if they have two cards of the same rank), or surrender (give up half their bet and retire from the hand).

Here's how to play blackjack like Benicio Del Toro:

"I like to keep things simple," Benicio Del Toro said in a recent interview. "I don't like to complicate my life with too many things."

This philosophy has certainly served the actor well in his personal life, and it also applies to his approach to blackjack. Here are some of Del Toro's tips for playing the game:

1. Don't overcomplicate things. Just because a casino offers lots of different blackjack variants doesn't mean you have to play them all. Stick to the basics and you'll be fine.

2. Know your odds. The more you know about the house edge on different blackjack games, the better equipped you'll be to make informed decisions about which ones to play.

3. Stay disciplined. It can be easy to get carried away when you're winning, but remember that blackjack is a game of chance and you can still lose in spite of your best efforts. Stay cool and collected no matter what the cards are doing.

4. Use basic strategy charts. These handy guides tell you exactly how to play any given hand, depending on the cards you're dealt. A good chart will give you a slight edge over the house, so make sure to use it!

5. Be aware of camouflage bets. Some casinos try to lure players into making bad decisions by offering complicated wagers that don't actually have any real edge over the player. Steer clear of these bets and stick with simple strategies instead.

Furthermore, there are a number of restrictions on the types of games that can be played online. Slot machines, roulette, and blackjack are all permitted, but sports betting and other casino games are not allowed. Poker is also not permitted in Monaco, so players looking to play this game should look for an offshore site that accepts players from Monaco.

#  Monaco gambling site offers refunds to unhappy customers

In a move that is sure to please unhappy customers, the Monaco-based gambling site, mBitcasino.com, has announced that it will be refunding all deposits made in the past week.

The announcement comes after a series of customer complaints about the site's operations. Many people have taken to social media to voice their displeasure with what they see as a lack of customer service from the site.

## Monaco online casinos

On Tuesday, the government of the Principality of Monaco announced that it was working with local online casino operators to offer refunds to players who had lost money as a result of last week's cyberattack. The move came after news broke over the weekend that several leading casinos based in Monaco had been targeted by a ransomware campaign that had resulted in the theft of millions of euros.

The head of the Monegasque gaming authority, Jean-Luc Neptune, said in a statement that the government was "working hand in hand with the casino operators affected by this attack to find solutions so that players can be reimbursed for their losses as quickly as possible." He added that although no definitive timeline had yet been set, he hoped that players would start seeing reimbursements within the next few days.

The cyberattack on Monaco's online casinos came just weeks after a similar assault on casinos in neighboring Andorra. In that case, too, players were offered refunds following the attack.

This is not the first time that Monaco's gaming industry has come under fire. In 2015, several employees at the state-owned Société des Bains de Mer (SBM) – which operates some of Monaco's most iconic casinos, including the Monte Carlo Casino and Café de Paris – were arrested as part of an investigation into money laundering and tax evasion.

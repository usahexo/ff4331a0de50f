#  Pocket Rockets Win Again!

The Rockets continue their winning ways with a 111-105 victory over the Timberwolves. James Harden led the way with 29 points and 10 assists, while Chris Paul chipped in with 20 points and 10 rebounds.

With the victory, the Rockets improve to 7-1 on the season. They have now beaten every team in the league at least once, with the exception of the Golden State Warriors.

Houston is looking like a real contender this season. The addition of Chris Paul has made them one of the best teams in the league, and they appear to be a serious threat to win the championship.

The Rockets will next take on the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday night.

#  Big Slick Beats Out Small Pair

In a hand of Texas Hold'em, when should you risk your entire stack with a Big Slick (A-K) against a small pair?

There's no definitive answer, as it depends on the specific situation. However, in general you should usually bet or raise with Big Slick if you think you have the best hand. This is because a small pair is likely to onlywin about one third of the time, while Big Slick has around a two-thirds chance of winning.

Furthermore, since you have such a big edge when you have Big Slick, it's often worth risking your whole stack to try and win the pot. In some cases, your opponents may even fold their small pair if they see that you're willing to gamble your stack with Big Slick.

Of course, there are also times when it's better to fold Big Slick. For example, if there's a lot of betting and raising preflop, then there's a good chance that someone has a better hand than you. In this case, it may be wise to fold and save your chips for another hand.

#  Ace-Queen Dominates Field

The ace-queen combination is one that dominates most other hands in the field. The reason for this is that the ace has a lot of power, and the queen is a very strong card. When these two are combined, they create a hand that is almost unbeatable.

In fact, there are very few hands that can stand up to an ace-queen. In most cases, the player with this hand will be able to take down the pot easily. This makes it a great hand to have when playing poker or any other card game.

There are a few things that you can do to make sure that you are able to take advantage of your ace-queen hand. First, make sure that you bet aggressively when you have this hand. You want your opponents to know that you are not someone they want to mess with.

Additionally, try to keep track of what the other players are holding. If you know that someone else has a weak hand, you can take them down easily. Remember, the ace-queen combination is very hard to beat, so use it to your advantage!

#  King-Ten Wins Sixth Straight

Tommy King-Ten Chan has notched his sixth consecutive victory on the professional tennis tour, this time in a hard-fought three setter over rising Japanese star Kei Nishikori.

King-Ten played aggressively from the outset, taking command of the match with some big groundstrokes and pinpoint serving. Nishikori mounted a late comeback attempt but it was not enough, and King-Ten emerged victorious 6-4, 4-6, 7-5.

"I'm very happy to have won again," said King-Ten after the match. "Kei is a great player and I had to stay focused throughout to come out on top."

This latest win puts King-Ten up to No. 9 in the ATP world rankings and cements his position as one of the top players on tour. Fans can expect big things from him as he continues his march towards Grand Slam glory.

#  Poker Pro Claims Second Victory In A Row!

In a stunning turn of events, poker pro extraordinaire 'John Doe' has managed to secure his second successive victory at the world-renowned 'Las Vegas Poker Championship'. This latest win further cements his position as one of the most successful players on the planet and comes hot on the heels of his other recent successes.

Some observers had predicted that Doe's luck might finally run out after an impressive winning streak, but he once again proved them wrong with a brilliant display of card-playing prowess. Coming into the final round as chip-leader, Doe didn't buckle under pressure and played some astutely timed bluffing moves to seal another famous victory.

In interviews after the game, Doe was typically modest and said that he was just lucky on the night. However, those who know him well say that there's more to Doe than just blind luck - he's a consummate professional who knows how to read his opponents and take advantage of their weaknesses.

Whatever the truth may be, there's no doubt that Doe is one of the most formidable poker players in the business and will be a tough opponent to beat in future tournaments. Congratulations on another amazing victory, John!

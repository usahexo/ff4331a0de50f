3) If either player has a total of eight or nine, that player automatically wins. If neither player has an eight or nine, then the hand continues.

#  Baccarat In Cards Ratiopharm Ulm – A Fascinating Card Game!

If you love excitement and enjoy gambling then you will definitely love playing Baccarat! This popular card game is a favorite among casino goers and can be enjoyed by players of all levels of experience. The object of the game is to draw cards with a point value as close to 9 as possible.

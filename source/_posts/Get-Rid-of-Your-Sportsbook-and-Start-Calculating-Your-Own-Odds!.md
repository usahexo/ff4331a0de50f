#  Get Rid of Your Sportsbook and Start Calculating Your Own Odds!

As a sports fan, you’ve probably experienced the sting of betting against the house. Whether you’re picking games against the spread or betting on the outright winner, paying the sportsbook always seems to come at a price. You may even feel like you’re getting ripped off every time you place a bet!

The good news is that there’s a way to get around this - and it doesn’t involve giving up your love of sports betting altogether. All you need is a basic understanding of probability and odds calculation, which you can easily do using a few simple formulas.

In this article, we’ll teach you how to calculate your own odds and give you some tips on how to make money betting on sports. So let’s get started!

# How Probability Works

At its core, probability is all about considering all of the possible outcomes of an event and then calculating the likelihood of each outcome happening. This can be done using a variety of different formulas, but in most cases it boils down to two simple steps:

1) Define the event. For example, let's say you want to calculate the odds for a football game between two teams, A and B. In this case, the event would be either Team A or Team B winning the game.

2) Consider all of the possible outcomes for the event. In our example, there are three possible outcomes: Team A winning, Team B winning, or the game ending in a draw.

Now that we have defined our event and considered all of its possible outcomes, we can begin calculating the odds for each outcome. But before we do that, we need to introduce one more concept: probability density function (PDF). Simply put, PDF is a measure of how likely an event is to occur relative to all other events. In other words, it tells us how likely it is for any given outcome to happen. To calculate PDF, we use something called a binomial distribution formula:

$$\text{PDF} = \frac{\text{number of favourable outcomes}}{\text{total number of possible outcomes}}$$

Don't worry if this formula looks intimidating - we'll walk through an example later on. For now, just remember that PDF tells us how likely each outcome is relative to all other outcomes. With that in mind, let's move on to calculating our odds!


# Calculating Odds Using Probability Density Function (PDF)

Now that we understand PDF, calculating our odds is actually quite easy. All we need to do is find out what percentage of favourable outcomes each outcome represents and then multiply these percentages by one another. Let's take a look at an example:





















      Unknown $50 $60 Win $10 $10 Lose -$40 -$50 Total $30 $0 Probability Density Function (PDF) for this problem = $\frac{{10}}{{30}}$ = %33 %33 × %100 = %11

#  The Best Way to Figure Out How Much to Bet on Sports

Making a bet on sports can be a fun and exciting experience, but it’s important to make sure you are wagering in a way that is going to give you the best chance to win. There are a lot of different ways to bet on sports, so it can be tricky to figure out how much money to put down on each game.

In this article, we are going to take a look at some of the different ways you can gamble on sports and offer some tips on how to figure out the right amount to bet.

Point Spread Betting

The most common way to bet on sports is through point spread betting. In this type of wager, you are betting on which team will cover the spread. The spread is a number that is set by the bookmakers that represents the margin of victory that they expect between the two teams.

So, for example, if the Patriots are playing the Jets and the spread is set at 7 points, then the Patriots would have to win by more than 7 points for people who bet on them to win their bets. If the Jets were to win or lose by exactly 7 points, then bets placed on them would be considered “push” bets and would result in no winner or loser being declared.

When betting on point spreads, you will typically need to wager somewhere between $10 and $20 per game. However, there are some exceptions where you might want to place a larger or smaller wager. For instance, if you think there is a good chance that one team will blow out the other, then you might want to wager more money on that game. Conversely, if you think there is a good chance that one team will keep things close, then you might want to bet less money.

Money Line Bets

Another common way to gamble on sports is through money line bets. In this type of wager, you simply betting on which team will win the game outright. There is no point spread involved in this type of bet.

Money line bets can be a bit more risky than point spread betting because your chances of winning are not as high. However, they can also be more profitable if you correctly pick the winner of the game. When placing money line bets, you will typically need to wager between $1 and $5 per game.

However, there may be occasions where it makes sense to place larger or smaller wagers depending on which team you think is going to win. For example, if you think there is a great chance that one team will dominate another team then you might want place a larger wager on that team’s money line odds. Conversely, if there is less certainty about who will win then it might be wise to place a smaller wager instead.


  Parlay Betting 

Another option for those looking for higher payouts is parlay betting .With parlay betting ,you combine multiple bets into one single Wager . all your selections must hit in order for You To Win your Parlay . So unlike regular single game bets where even if 1 selection loses ,you still have half your original stake returned , with parlay betting all your selections must hit or You Lose Your Entire Wager . 

For example , let's say You Have 3 games picked And The Odds Are: 

- Seahawks -2½ @ -125 
- Steelers -7 @ -140 - Jaguars +9 @ +190 

 Your initial Wager Would Be: (3 X $5) = $15 

If all three games hit ,You Would Win (3 X 6) = 18 units minus your original stake of 15 = 3 units Profit  

Now let's say one game loses ,Your new Wager would be: (2 X $5) = $10 

If both other games hit ,You Would Win (2 X 6) = 12 units minus your original stake of 10 = 2 units Profit

#  Stop Losing Money Betting on Sports – Learn How To Calculate Value!

We’ve all been there. That sick feeling in the pit of your stomach when you realize you just lost another bet on the game. You promised yourself you wouldn’t bet on sports again, but here you are, ready to do it all over again. It feels like you can’t help but make bad bets that always seem to lose money.

If only there was a way to stop losing money betting on sports …

Actually, there is! By learning how to calculate value, you can start making winning bets and make all those loser bets a thing of the past. In this article, we’re going to teach you how to do just that!

What is Value?

In order to understand how to calculate value, you first need to understand what it is. In very simple terms, value is the amount of money you expect to win divided by the amount of money you risk. In mathematical terms, it is expressed as:

value = (expected return – expected cost) / expected cost

This formula looks at the potential outcomes of a bet and calculates which one has the highest value. If the value is positive, then that bet has value and should be placed. If the value is negative, then that bet does not have value and should be avoided.

How To Calculate Value?

Now that you understand what value is, let’s take a look at how to calculate it for a given bet. There are three steps involved in this process: determining the odds for each outcome, calculating the expected return for each outcome, and then plugging these numbers into the equation above. Let’s take a closer look at each step:

1) Determining Odds For Each Outcome: In order to calculate value, you need to know the odds for each outcome of a bet. This can be done by using a variety of resources, such as online calculators or betting exchanges . For this example, we will use an online calculator . First, select the sport and type in the information necessary for the calculation (e.g., teams playing, odds at time of writing). Once you have input these numbers into the calculator, it will give you three sets of odds: decimal odds (e.g., 1.45), percentage odds (e.g., 45%), and fractional odds (e.g., 7/2). We will use decimal odds for our calculations in this example .



























9 	2) Calculating Expected Return For Each Outcome: The next step is to calculate the expected return for each outcome using the following formula: ((1 / Odds) * Win Amount) + (((100 / Odds) - 1) * Lose Amount). For our example , we will use Manchester City's match against Tottenham Hotspur on September 9th , 2018 . At the time of writing , Manchester City had decimal odds of 1.45 while Tottenham Hotspur had odds of 6 . Let's say someone wanted to place a £10 bet on Manchester City winning . The expected return would be calculated as follows: ((1/1 . 45) * 10) + (((100/1 . 45) - 1) * -10) = 9 . 09% return on investment . 	3) Plugging Numbers Into Formula: Now that we have determinedexpected returns for each outcome , we can plug these numbers into ourvalue equation :value = (expected return – expected cost) / expected cost= (-10% – 9 . 09%) / 9 . 09% = -0 . 11 This means thatthe bet does not havevalue and should be avoided

#  Finally, An Easy Way To Figure Out How Much Money To Wager On Any Game

Almost everyone enjoys a good wager every now and again, but not all of us are experts at calculating how much to bet. You may be asking yourself how much money should you wager on this game? 

There is actually an easy way to figure out how much money to wager on any game. You just need to use a simple equation that takes into account the odds for each team, as well as your bankroll. The equation is: (Odds x Bankroll) / (Odds + 1). 

For example, if you have a bankroll of $100 and the odds for each team are even, then you would wager $50 on each team. If the odds were 3/1 for one team and 2/1 for the other team, then you would wager $33.33 on the first team and $16.67 on the second team. 

The equation can also be used to figure out how much to bet when there is no favorite. In this case, you would simply use 1 in place of the odds for each team in the equation. 

This equation makes it easy to make informed decisions about how much money to wager on any game, regardless of whether or not there is a favorite. So, next time you're placing a bet, be sure to use this equation to ensure that you're making the most educated decision possible!

#  Mastering the Art of Sports Wagering: How to Calculate Value

One of the most important skills for any sports bettor is being able to calculate value. Simply put, this means finding bets where the odds offered by the sportsbook are not reflective of the true chances of that outcome happening. In other words, you are getting more value on your bet than what is being offered by the house.

Finding and exploiting these opportunities is the key to consistent winning in sports wagering. It is also what separates the amateurs from the pros. So, how do we go about calculating value?

There are a few different methods that can be used, but we’ll focus on two of the most common: using expected value (EV) and unit investment.

Expected Value (EV)

The simplest way to calculate value is to use EV. This takes into account the probability of an event happening as well as the payout offered by the sportsbook. In order to use EV, you need to first understand how to calculate probability.


This can be done by using a simple formula: number of desired outcomes divided by total number of possible outcomes. For example, if you want to know the probability of flipping a coin and it landing on heads, there are only two possible outcomes (heads or tails), so the probability would be 1/2 or 50%.


Once you have calculated the probability of an event happening, all you need to do is multiply it by the payout offered by the sportsbook. This will give you your expected return for that particular bet. For example, if you place a $10 bet on heads at even odds and it lands on heads, you would expect to win $10 back (plus your original stake). However, if it lands on tails, you would lose your $10 stake.


To sum up, here’s what you need to do in order to calculate EV:

  -Calculate the probability of an event happening 
-Multiply it by the payout offered by the sportsbook 
-This will give you your expected return for that particular bet


Using this method, you can easily compare different bets and see which ones offer more value. Let’s take a look at an example.


 suppose Manchester United are playing against Huddersfield Town in an upcoming Premier League match. The odds offered on Man U winning are 1/6 (or -833) while Huddersfield Town are quoted at 7/1 (or +600). Using EV, we can see that betting on Manchester United offers very little value and that Huddersfield Town represent much better bang for our buck. In fact, betting £100 on Huddersfield Town would pay out £700 if they pull off an upset!


Unit Investment Method
Another way of calculating value is through unit investment. This method takes into account how much money you are willing to risk on each bet in order to achieve a certain profit target. In other words, it measures how much value each bet represents in relation to your overall bankroll or betting budget.



  To start off, you will need to come up with a unit size or bankroll size for yourself. This will be the amount of money that you are prepared to risk on each individual wager. Once you have decided on this amount, simply divide it by 100 (or any other multiplier) in order to get your unit size (£10 per unit when using £100 as your bankroll). So now we have our base unit size down let's move onto building our portfolio...   To begin with we want firstly identify bets which offer an edge over Vegas e make sure these bets fit comfortably within our chosen Unit Size or Bank Roll below is an example identifying such bets  For simplicity lets assume in our portfolio we have 30 such bets—again these don’t all have ti hit but form over time gives us positive expectation & allows us ti increase stakes as our bank roll grows On any given day we select 4-5 matches where vegas has incorrect line giving us positive expectation assuming same stakes If when looking back over several days / weeks / months etc there aren’t enough Value Bets then reduce Unit Size until next time period provides more opportunities When looking back through data try not ti always “chase winners” consider mothballing some selections when current trend suggests negative expectation awaits Selections highlighted in YELLOW represent 5% Expected Value or greater at selected Unit Size Now lets look at an example picking games taking place over next 7 days Sunday 26th November Sunday Liverpool v Southampton Navas FULL TIME DRAW 2/1 Monday 27th November Middlesbrough v Swansea 2 Burnley v Stoke 3 Crystal Palace v Watford X2 away Tuesday 28th November Tottenham v West Ham 1 Wednesday 29th November Everton v Chelsea 2 Thursday 30th November Liverpool v Chelsea DOUBLE CHANCE LIVERPOOL OR Draw Friday 1

#  When did Del Toro begin his acting career?

It is tough to determine when exactly Del Toro began his acting career. Most sources agree that he started appearing in commercials at the age of nine. However, his first credited role was in the 1983 movie “El Pantano” as Chucho.

#  What was his first major movie role?

His first major movie role was in the year 2000, when he starred in the movie "Finding Forrester."

#  What is the name of his talent agency?
Which company does he work for?
What is his real name?

These are some of the questions that people have been asking about the popular Korean singer and actor, Kim Jaejoong. Kim is a part of the popular South Korean boy band, JYJ, and has enjoyed success as an actor in dramas such as Protect the Boss and Dr. Champ. In addition to his work in Korea, Kim has also tried his hand at acting in Japan, China and Thailand. 

Despite his accomplishments, there are still many mysteries surrounding Kim Jaejoong. One of the biggest questions is what is the name of his talent agency? While it has been rumored to be C-JeS Entertainment, this has not been confirmed by either party. It is also unclear what company Kim Jaejoong works for. His activities as an actor and singer are managed by C-JeS Entertainment, but his personal website lists 2 different management companies- SidusHQ and Sweetch Productions.  

Another mystery that has yet to be solved is Kim Jaejoong's real name. Due to privacy reasons, he goes by his stage name rather than his legal name. However, there are many theories about what his real name may be. Some believe that it is Lee Seung Hyun, while others claim that it is Kim Sang Joong. Until Kim reveals his true identity, this will continue to be a mystery.

#  What are some of his favorite movies?

Last year, while being interviewed by Variety Magazine, Hollywood actor and producer George Clooney was asked about his favorite films. Clooney had a few, but he mentioned one in particular that he thought more people should see.

“I think ‘The Edge of Seventeen’ is an amazing film. I was really proud of Hailee Steinfeld in that; it’s a really tough role for a young actress. I also like ‘Hell or High Water’ – I thought it was a great film. It just feels like we’re making movies again that are worth going to see. There seems to be less and less of that, so it’s been nice to see these last two or three films come out.”

Clooney isn't the only one who has praised "The Edge of Seventeen." Since its release in November of 2016, the coming-of-age comedy has received critical acclaim from movie critics across the board. Rotten Tomatoes currently rates the movie at 89 percent, and Metacritic gives it a score of 77 out of 100.

While there are many positive reviews of the film, what makes "The Edge of Seventeen" so special is that it doesn't shy away from difficult topics like teenage depression and suicide. The movie follows Steinfeld's character Nadine as she tries to navigate her way through high school while dealing with family drama and her own mental health issues.

#  Does he have any siblings?

No, the Prince has no siblings.

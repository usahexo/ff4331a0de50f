#  Poker Palau for beginners: How to get started 

If you're new to poker, Palau may be the perfect place to start. This Pacific island nation has a wealth of casinos and poker rooms, making it easy to find a game. And because the competition is relatively soft, beginners can hone their skills without fear of losing too much money.

 Just getting started in poker can be daunting. There's so much to learn: what hands to play, how to bluff, when to fold. But don't worry - we're here to help! In this article, we'll teach you the basics of poker Palau style. We'll start with the game itself and work our way up to some basic strategy tips. So let's get started!

What is Poker Palau? 

For starters, let's define what we mean by "Poker Palau." Poker Palau is a term used to describe the particular variant of poker that is played in Palau. This version of the game is based on Texas Hold'em, but there are several key differences. Chief among these are the use of community cards (shared cards), which gives players more opportunities to make winning hands.

Another important difference is that Palauan poker uses a stripped deck - meaning that some cards are removed from the deck, making it easier for players to form straights and flushes. Straights and flushes still pay out at the same rate as in traditional Texas Hold'em, but they are a bit easier to make.

How do I Play? 

Now that you know a bit about Poker Palau, let's take a look at how the game is actually played. The basic premise is simple: each player is dealt two cards face down, and then five community cards are dealt face up in the middle of the table. Players then take turns betting on their hand - either betting "high" or "low." The player with the best hand (based on traditional poker rankings) wins the pot.

Let's walk through an example hand so you can see how it works:

     Player 1: K♣ 10♦     Player 2: 5♠ 4♥ 

 In this hand, Player 1 has two high cards - a King and a Ten. Meanwhile, Player 2 holds two low cards - a Five and Four. Because high cards are better than low cards, Player 1 would be considered the favorite in this hand (assuming no one else has a better hand).

The first round of betting begins with Player 1, who bets "high." Player 2 then decides whether or not to call (match) this bet. If they choose not to call, they can fold (drop out of the hand) or raise (increase the size of the bet). If both players call, we move on to the next round of betting.

In this particular hand, Player 2 decides not to call and folds instead. This means that Player 1 wins whatever amount was bet during that round (in this case, $10).

#  5 Best Casino Games for Craps Fans!

Craps is one of the most popular casino games in the world, enjoyed by both novice and experienced players alike. If you’re a craps fan, these five games are sure to excite and entertain you!

1. Double Exposure Blackjack

Double Exposure Blackjack is a variant of the traditional game that offers more excitement and opportunities for big wins. In this version, both dealer cards are exposed at the start of the game, which gives players a better chance of winning.

2. Single Deck Blackjack

Single Deck Blackjack is another thrilling variation that offers an extra level of excitement. The game is played with just one deck of cards, which means there are fewer possibilities for the dealer to draw a winning hand. This makes it a more favourable game for players!

#  Craps Thrills at the Atlantic City Casino 

There’s nothing like the sound of dice bouncing off a craps table to get your heart racing, and the excitement of playing the game in person at an Atlantic City casino is hard to beat. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned pro, these casinos have something for everyone, with table minimums starting as low as $5 and some of the best odds in the business.

If you’re new to craps, the basic premise is simple: you bet on the outcome of a roll of two dice. A variety of bets are available, including betting on a specific number (called a “pass line bet”), betting that the dice will land on certain combinations (like doubles), or betting that they will come up as different numbers (called “point bets”).

The key to winning at craps is making smart bets, and there are plenty of experienced players happy to share their tips. One important thing to remember is that don’t be afraid to take risks – but also don’t bet more than you can afford to lose.

When it comes to choosing a casino, there are plenty of factors to consider. Some people prefer smaller casinos with more personal service, while others prefer the bigger, glitzier resorts. Whatever your preference, there’s sure to be an Atlantic City casino that meets your needs.

#  Tips for a Winning Craps Game

When you walk up to a craps table, you may be overwhelmed by all of the different betting options available to you. This can lead to some costly mistakes if you’re not sure what you’re doing. In this article, we’re going to give you some tips for playing craps so that you can come away a winner.

The first thing to understand is the basic bet types. The most common bets are called pass and don't pass. With a pass bet, you're betting that the shooter will roll a 7 or 11 on the next roll. If they roll anything else, your bet loses. With a don't pass bet, you're betting that the shooter will roll 2, 3 or 12 on the next roll (the odds are higher for these numbers because they're considered "point" numbers). If the shooter rolls a 7 before one of those point numbers comes up, your bet loses.

Aside from these two basic bets, there are also side bets which can be made. These are bets that are not related to the outcome of the next roll. Some popular side bets include betting on whether or not the shooter will make their point number, or betting on specific combinations of dice rolls.

Now that you understand the basics of craps betting, let's talk about how to increase your chances of winning. One thing to keep in mind is that it's important to always make sure you have enough money left to make subsequent bets if your current bet loses - otherwise, you'll be forced to leave the table.

One way to increase your chances of winning is to make small bets and increase them as you win. This way, even if you do lose some money overall, you'll still have some wins under your belt which will offset those losses. Another thing to keep in mind is that many casino staff members are willing to give advice on how best to play craps - so don't be afraid to ask them for help!

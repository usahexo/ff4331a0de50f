#  Arizona Goes From 16 to 21 for Gambling

In April, the Arizona state Senate voted to legalize casino gambling, approving a bill that would raise the number of casinos in the state from 16 to 21. The vote was largely partisan, with 18 Republicans in favor and nine Democrats opposed. The passage of the bill means that there will be two more casino licenses available for bidding, one each in Tucson and Flagstaff.

The legalization of gambling in Arizona has been a long time coming. For years, lawmakers have unsuccessfully tried to pass bills that would expand gambling in the state. In 2013, a bill that would have allowed for five new casinos failed to pass the House by just three votes.

Sponsors of the new bill say that it is necessary to bring more jobs and revenue to the state. Opponents argue that gambling is addictive and can lead to financial and personal hardship.

Arizona is not the only state where lawmakers are grappling with how to best use gambling revenues. In Iowa, for example, there is a debate over whether or not to allow casinos in counties that do not currently have them. And in California, there is discussion about whether or not to allow online poker.

The expansion of gambling in Arizona is likely to face legal challenges. There are already two lawsuits pending against the state over its existing gaming laws. It remains to be seen how the courts will rule on these cases, but it seems likely that there will be more legal battles ahead as states continue to grapple with how best to use gambling revenues.

#  Arizona Makes Changes to gambling Laws

In a unanimous decision, the Arizona State Senate has voted to legalize and regulate fantasy sports contests in the state. The new legislation means that players will now be able to compete in fantasy contests for money without fear of prosecution. The bill was sponsored by Representative Vince Leach, who said that the move would help to protect Arizonans who choose to participate in fantasy sports contests.

“Fantasy sports are a big business and there is a lot of money changing hands,” Leach said in a statement. “Arizonans should not have to worry about being arrested for taking part in something that is legal in most other states. This bill will help to protect our citizens and ensure that our state is competitive with other states when it comes to attracting this type of business.”

The new law makes Arizona the fifteenth state to legalize and regulate fantasy sports contests. It will come into effect on August 9th, 2018. In addition to legalizing fantasy sports, the new law also establishes a licensing system for those wishing to offer such contests in Arizona. It also imposes a number of consumer protection measures, including age restrictions and requirements that operators protect player funds.

FanDuel welcomed the news, saying that it would invest more heavily in Arizona thanks to the new legislation. “We applaud Rep. Vince Leach and the Arizona Legislature for their leadership on this issue and their commitment to ensuring that fantasy sports are treated fairly in Arizona,” said FanDuel spokesperson Emily Grelli. “This legislation marks an important step forward for fans in Arizona and we look forward to bringing even more innovation and investment to the state as a result.”

DraftKings also released a statement praising the new law. “We applaud Rep. Vince Leach and the Arizona Legislature for their leadership on this issue and their commitment to ensuring that fantasy sports are treated fairly in Arizona,” said DraftKings spokesperson Jesse Lawrence. “This legislation marks an important step forward for fans in Arizona and we look forward to bringing even more innovation and investment to the state as a result.”

#  Arizona Moves Forward with Gambling Regulations

Arizona lawmakers are on track to approve new gambling regulations, which would allow gaming machines at bars and clubs.

The proposed bill cleared its first hurdle on Wednesday when it was approved by the Arizona Senate Regulatory Affairs Committee. The next step is a vote by the full state Senate, which is expected to take place in the coming days.

Governor Doug Ducey is behind the proposed regulations, and has said that they will help create jobs and generate additional revenue for the state’s coffers.

Opposition to the new regulations has come from various quarters, including Indian tribes that operate casinos in the state. They argue that the new rules will hurt their businesses and lead to job losses.

Under the proposed regulations, bars and clubs could install up to five gaming machines each. The machines would be allowed to accept cash and would pay out prizes of up to $500.

Players would have to be at least 21 years old in order to use the machines, and they would not be allowed to bet more than $10 per spin.

#  Arizona Adopts New Gambling Laws

In a landmark ruling, the Arizona Supreme Court has struck down key portions of the state’s anti-gambling laws. The new decision opens the door for Indian tribes to operate full-scale casinos in the state, and is expected to trigger a major gambling boom.

Arizona has long been considered one of the most restrictive states when it comes to gambling. The anti-gambling laws were originally passed in the late 1800s, and were among some of the most stringent in the country. Over time, however, they had become increasingly outdated and irrelevant.

The new ruling overturns a number of key provisions in the anti-gambling laws, including those that prohibit Indian tribes from operating casinos. It also allows for the expansion of casino gambling, including slots and roulette.

Supporters of the ruling argue that it will create much-needed jobs and bring much-needed revenue to the state. Casino operators estimate that the gambling industry could generate as much as $1 billion in annual revenue for Arizona.

Critics, however, argue that the gambling industry is rife with corruption and addiction. They warn that the new laws could lead to a major increase in problem gambling in Arizona.

#  Arizona Updates Gambling Regulations

The Arizona legislature has been busy revising the regulations around gambling in the state. In response to recent court rulings, lawmakers have proposed a new bill that would legalize and regulate paid fantasy sports. The proposed bill would require operators of paid fantasy sports to pay a license fee and comply with other regulatory requirements.

In addition, lawmakers are working on a bill that would allow tribes to offer craps and roulette at their casinos. The proposed bill would establish a regulatory framework for craps and roulette, including minimum age requirements and limits on the amount of money that can be wagered.

These bills are in addition to the legislation that was passed last year legalizing online poker in the state. That legislation is still awaiting final approval from the governor.
